***** HTML TAGS *****

**** SMALL TAG ****

**
Small text, such as တဠne print. The HTML Small Element (<small>)
makes the text font size one size smaller (for example, from large to
medium, or from small to x-small) down to the browser's minimum
font size. In HTML5, this element is repurposed to represent sidecomments and small print, including copyright and legal text,
independent of its styled presentation.
**

**** SPAN TAG ****

**
Container with no semantic meaning. The HTML <span> element is a
generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not
inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for
styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they
share attribute values, such as lang. It should be used only when no
other semantic element is appropriate. <span> is very much like a
<div> element, but <div> is a block-level element whereas a <span> is
<p>Regular text. <samp>This is sample text.
</samp> Regular text.</p>
<p>This is the first sentence.  <small>This 
whole sentence is in small letters.</small>
</p>
<div> element, but <div> is a block-level element whereas a <span> is
an inline element.
**

**** STRONG TAG ****

**
Text that is important. The HTML Strong Element (<strong>) gives
text strong importance, and is typically displayed in bold.
**

**** SUB TAG ****

**
Subscript text. The HTML Subscript Element (<sub>) deတဠnes a span of
text that should be displayed, for typographic reasons, lower, and
often smaller, than the main span of text.
**

**** SUP TAG ****

**
 Superscript text. The HTML Superscript Element (<sup>) deတဠnes a
 span of text that should be displayed, for typographic reasons, 
 higher, and often smaller, than the main span of text
**

**** TIME TAG ****

**
Time deတဠned in a machine readable format. The HTML <time>
element represents either a time on a 24-hour clock or a precise date
in the Gregorian calendar (with optional time and timezone
information). This element is intended to be used presenting dates
and times in a machine readable format. This can be helpful for user
agents to o†‐er any event scheduling for user's calendar
**

**** CAPTION TAG ****

**
Title of a table. The HTML <caption> Element (or HTML Table Caption
Element) represents the title of a table. Though it is always the တဠrst
descendant of a <table>, its styling, using CSS, may place it
elsewhere, relative to the table.
**

**** COL TAG ****

**
Columns in a table. The HTML Table Column Element (<col>) deတဠnes a
column within a table and is used for deတဠning common semantics on
all common cells. It is generally found within a <colgroup> element.
**

**** COLGROUP TAG ****
**
 Deတဠnes a group of columns in a table. The HTML Table Column Group
 Element (<colgroup>) deတဠnes a group of columns within a table.
**


**** TABLE TAG ****

**
 Table of multi-dimensional data. The HTML Table Element (<table>) 
 represents tabular data: information expressed via two dimensions
 or more.
**

**** TBODҮ TAG ****

**
Contains rows that hold the table's data. The HTML Table Body
Element (<tbody>) deတဠnes one or more <tr> element data-rows to be
the body of its parent <table> element (as long as no <tr> elements
are immediate children of that table element.) In conjunction with a
preceding <thead> and/or <tfoot> element, <tbody> provides
additional semantic information for devices such as printers and
displays. Of the parent table's child elements, <tbody> represents the
content which, when longer than a page, will most likely di†‐er for
each page printed; while the content of <thead> and <tfoot> will be
the same or similar for each page printed. For displays, <tbody> will
enable separate scrolling of the <thead>, <tfoot>, and <caption>
elements of the same parent <table> element. Note that unlike the
<thead>, <tfoot>, and <caption> elements however, multiple <tbody>
elements are permitted (if consecutive), allowing the data-rows in
long tables to be divided into di†‐erent sections, each separately
formatted as needed.
**

**** TD TAG ****

**
 Table cell. The Table cell HTML element (<td>) deတဠnes a cell of a table
 that contains data. It participates in the table model.
**

**** TFOOT TAG **** 

** 
 Contains rows with summary of data. The HTML Table Foot Element
 (<tfoot>) deတဠnes a set of rows summarizing the columns of the table.
**
 
****  TH TAG ****

**
Table heading. The HTML element table header cell <th> deတဠnes a
cell as a header for a group of cells of a table. The group of cells that
the header refers to is deတဠned by the scope and headers attribute.
**

**** TR TAG ****

**
 A row of cells in a table. The HTML element table row <tr> deတဠnes a
 row of cells in a table. Those can be a mix of <td> and <th> elements.
**

**** BUTTON TAG ****

**
 A button. The HTML <button> Element represents a clickable button.
