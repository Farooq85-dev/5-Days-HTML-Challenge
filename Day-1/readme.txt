***** Short Introduction to HTML *****

**
 HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) has come a long way since Tim Berners-Lee invented it back in 1991. Today HTML5 is the standard version and it's supported by all modern web browsers.
**

**** HTML TAG ****

**
 Speciတဠes an html document. The HTML <html> element (or HTML
 root element) represents the root of an HTML document. All other
 elements must be descendants of this element. Since the <html>
 element is the တဠrst in a document other than comments, it is called
 the root element. Although this tag can be implied, or not required,
 with HTML, it is required to be opened and closed in XHTML. 
**

**** BASE TAG ****

**
 The <base> tag specifies the base URL and/or target for all relative URLs in a document. The <base> tag must have either an href or a target attribute present, or both. There can only be one single <base>    element in a document, and it must be inside the <head> element.
**

****  HEAD TAG ****

**
 First element of the HTML document. Collection of metadata for the
 Document. The HTML <head> element provides general information
 (metadata) about the document, including its title and links to its
 scripts and style sheets. 
**

****  LINK TAG ****

**
 Other resources related to the document. The HTML <link> element
 speciတဠes relationships between the current document and an
 external resource. Possible uses for this element include deတဠning a
 relational framework for navigation. This Element is most used to
 link to style sheets
 **

**** META TAG **** 

**
 Document metadata that can't be expressed with other elements.
**


**** STҮLE TAG ****

**
 Embed style information in the documents. The HTML <style>
 element contains style information for a document, or part of a
 document. By default, the style instructions written inside that
 element are expected to be CSS.
**


**** TITLE TAG ****
**
 Document title or name. The HTML <title> element deတဠnes the title
 of the document, shown in a browser's title bar or on the page's tab.
 It can only contain text, and any contained tags are ignored. 
**

**** ADDRESS TAG ****

**
 The HTML <address> element supplies contact information for its
 nearest <article> or <body> ancestor; in the latter case, it applies to
 the whole document
**

**** ARTICLE TAG ****

**
 Section of the page content, such as a blog or forum post.
