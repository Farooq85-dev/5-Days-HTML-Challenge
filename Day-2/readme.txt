***** Basic Tags *****

**** BODY TAG ****
**
 Main content of the document. The HTML <body> Element
 represents the content of an HTML document. There can be only one
 <body> element in a document
**


****  FOOTER TAG **** 

**
 Footer of the current section. The HTML <footer> element
 represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content or sectioning
 root element. A footer typically contains information about the
 author of the section, copyright data or links to related documents

**

**** H1 TO H6 TAG **** 

**
 Heading for the current section. Heading elements implement six
 levels of document headings, <h1> is the most important and <h6> is
 the least. A heading element brie†ဠy describes the topic of the
 section it introduces. Heading information may be used by user
 agents, for example, to construct a table of contents for a document
 automatically
**

**** HEADER TAG ****

**
 Navigation or introductory elements for the current section. The
 HTML <header> element represents a group of introductory or
 navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also
 other elements like a logo, wrapped section's header, a search form,
 and so on
**

**** NAV TAG ****

**
 A section of a page that links to other pages. The HTML <nav>
 element (HTML Navigation Element) represents a section of a page
 that links to other pages or to parts within the page: a section with
 navigation links.
**

**** BLOCKQUOTE TAG ****

**
 Quote from another source. The HTML <blockquote> Element (or
 HTML Block Quotation Element) indicates that the enclosed text is an
 extended quotation. Usually, this is rendered visually by indentation
 (see Notes for how to change it). A URL for the source of the
 quotation may be given using the cite attribute, while a text
 representation of the source can be given using the <cite> element.
**

**** BR TAG ****

**
 Line break. The HTML element line break <br> produces a line break
 in text (carriage-return). It is useful for writing a poem or an address,
 where the division of lines is signiတဠcant. Do not use <br> to increase
 the gap between lines of text; use the CSS margin property or the
 <p> element
**

**** DD TAG ****

**
 Description, deတဠnition, or value, part of a term- description group in
 a description list. The HTML <dd> element (HTML Description
 Element) indicates the description of a term in a description list
 (<dl>) element. This element can occur only as a child element of a
 description list and it must follow a <dt> element
**


**** DIV TAG ****

**
 Container or section with no semantic meaning. The HTML <div>
 element (or HTML Document Division Element) is the generic
 container for †ဠow content, which does not inherently represent
 anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes
 (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute
 values, such as lang. It should be used only when no other semantic
 element (such as <article> or <nav>) is appropriate
**

**** DL TAG ****

**
 An association list consisting of zero or more name-value groups (a
 description list). The HTML <dl> element (or HTML Description List
 Element) encloses a list of pairs of terms and descriptions. Common
 uses for this element are to implement a glossary or to display
 metadata (a list of key-value pairs). Prior to HTML5, <dl> was known
 as a Deတဠnition List
**


**** DT TAG ****

**
 Term, or name, part of a term-description group in a description list.
 The HTML <dt> element (or HTML Deတဠnition Term Element) identiတဠes
 a term in a deတဠnition list. This element can occur only as a child
 element of a <dl>. It is usually followed by a <dd> element; however,
 multiple <dt> elements in a row indicate several terms that are all
 deတဠned by the immediate next <dd> element
**

**** FIGURE TAG ****

**
 Contains elements related to single concept, such as an illustration
 or code example. The HTML <တဠgure> element represents self
 contained content, frequently with a caption (<တဠgcaption>), and is
 typically referenced as a single unit. While it is related to the main
 †ဠow, its position is independent of the main †ဠow. Usually this is an
 image, an illustration, a diagram, a code snippet, or a schema that is
 referenced in the main text, but that can be moved to another page
 or to an appendix without a†‐ecting the main †ဠow.
 **

**** FIGCAPTION TAG ****

**
 Caption or legend for the တဠgure element. The HTML <တဠgcaption>
 element represents a caption or a legend associated with a တဠgure or
 an illustration described by the rest of the data of the <တဠgure>
 element which is its immediate ancestor which means <တဠgcaption>
 can be the တဠrst or last element inside a <တဠgure> block. Also, the
 HTML Figcaption Element is optional; if not provided, then the parent
 တဠgure element will have no caption
**

**** HR TAG ****

**
 Paragraph-level thematic break. The HTML <hr> element represents
 a thematic break between paragraph-level elements (for example, a
 change of scene in a story, or a shift of topic with a section). In
 previous versions of HTML, it represented a horizontal rule. It may
 still be displayed as a horizontal rule in visual browsers, but is now
 deတဠned in semantic terms, rather than presentational terms.
**

**** LI TAG ****

**
 List item. The HTML <li> element (or HTML List Item Element) is used
 to represent an item in a list. It must be contained in a parent
 element: an ordered list (<ol>), an unordered list (<ul>), or a menu
 (<menu>). In menus and unordered lists, list items are usually
 displayed using bullet points. In ordered lists, they are usually
 displayed with an ascending counter on the left, such as a number or
 letter
**

**** OL TAG ****

**
 Ordered list. The HTML <ol> Element (or HTML Ordered List Element)
 represents an ordered list of items. Typically, ordered-list items are
 displayed with a preceding numbering, which can be of any form, like
 numerals, letters or Romans numerals or even simple bullets. This
 numbered style is not deတဠned in the HTML description of the page,
 but in its associated CSS, using the list-style-type property. There is
 no limitation to the depth and overlap of lists deတဠned with the <ol>
 and <ul> elements.
**

**** P TAG ****

**
 Paragraph content. The HTML <p> element (or HTML Paragraph
 Element) represents a paragraph of text. Paragraphs are usually
 represented in visual media as blocks of text that are separated from
 adjacent blocks by vertical blank space and/or တဠrst-line indentation.
 Paragraphs are block-level elements.
**

**** UL TAG ****

**
 Unordered list. The HTML <ul> element (or HTML Unordered List
 Element) represents an unordered list of items, namely a collection
 of items that do not have a numerical ordering, and their order in
 the list is meaningless. Typically, unordered-list items are displayed
 with a bullet, which can be of several forms, like a dot, a circle or a
 squared. The bullet style is not deတဠned in the HTML description of
 the page, but in its associated CSS, using the list-style-type property
**

**** A TAG ****

**
 Hyperlink (a hypertext anchor). The HTML Anchor Element (<a> tag)
 deတဠnes a hyperlink to a location on the same page or any other page
 on the Web. It can also be used (in an obsolete way) to create an
 anchor point - a destination for hyperlinks within the content of a
 page, so that links aren't limited to connecting simply to the top of a
 page
