***** HTML TAGS *****



**** ABBR TAG ****

**
 Abbreviation or acronym. The <abbr> element (or HTML
 Abbreviation Element) represents an abbreviation and optionally
 provides a full description for it. If present, the title attribute must
 contain this full description and nothing else.
 **

**** B TAG ****

**
 Stylistically separated text of equal importance, such as a product
 name. The HTML <b> Element represents a span of text stylistically
 di†‐erent from normal text, without conveying any special
 importance or relevance. It is typically used for keywords in a
 summary, product names in a review, or other spans of text whose
 typical presentation would be boldfaced. Another example of its use
 is to mark the lead sentence of each paragraph of an article.

**** DEL TAG ****

**
 Text that has been removed during document editing. The HTML
 Deleted Text Element (<del>) represents a range of text that has
 been deleted from a document. This element is often (but need not
 be) rendered with strike-through text.
**

**** EM TAG ****

**
 Text that should be emphasized. The HTML element emphasis <em>
 marks text that has stress emphasis. The <em> element can be
 nested, with each level of nesting indicating a greater degree of
 emphasis.
**

**** I TAG ****

**
 Text in a alternate voice or mood, such as a technical term. The HTML
 <i> Element represents a range of text that is set o†‐ from the normal
 text for some reason, for example, technical terms, foreign language
 phrases, or တဠctional character thoughts. It is typically displayed in
 italic type.
**

**** KBD TAG ****

**
 Example input (usually keyboard) for a program. The HTML Keyboard
 Input Element (<kbd>) represents user input and produces an inline
 element displayed in the browser's default monospace font.
**

****  MARK TAG ****

**
 Text highlighted for referencing elsewhere. The HTML Mark Element
 (<mark>) represents highlighted text, i.e., a run of text marked for
 reference purpose, due to its relevance in a particular context. For
 example it can be used in a page showing search results to highlight
 every instance of the searched-for word
**

**** S TAG ****

**
 Strikethrough text that is outdated or no longer accurate. The HTML
 Strikethrough Element (<s>) renders text with a strikethrough, or a
 line through it. Use the <s> element to represent things that are no
 longer relevant or no longer accurate. However, <s> is not
 appropriate when indicating document edits; for that, use the <del>
 and <ins> elements, as appropriate.
**


**** SAMP TAG ****

**
 Sample output of a program. The HTML <samp> element is an
 element intended to identify sample output from a computer
 program. It is usually displayed in the browser's default monotype
 font (such as Lucida Console).
